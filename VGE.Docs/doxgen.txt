if I decide to go with "generated automatically using a tool like Doxygen (or a similar documentation generator)"

This part of the documentation structure indicates that the API Reference section will largely be generated automatically using a tool like Doxygen (or a similar documentation generator).

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Documenting Your Code:** You write special comments within your C++ source code files (`Node.h`, `Connection.h`, `Graph.h`, etc.) using Doxygen's syntax. These comments describe the purpose, parameters, return values, and other details of your classes, methods, and variables.

2. **Running Doxygen:** You run the Doxygen tool on your source code. Doxygen parses the comments and generates documentation in various formats (HTML, PDF, etc.).

3. **API Reference:** The generated documentation forms the bulk of your API Reference, providing detailed information about every documented element in your engine's codebase.

**Example Doxygen Comment:**

```c++
/**
 * @brief This class represents a node in the visual scripting graph.
 * 
 * @details A node can have different types (e.g., Event, Variable, Function) 
 * and can be connected to other nodes to create complex logic flows.
 */
class Node {
public:
    /**
     * @brief Gets the name of the node.
     * @return The name of the node.
     */
    std::string GetName() const;

    // ... other methods and properties
};
```

**Benefits of Using a Documentation Generator**

* **Saves Time and Effort:**  You don't have to manually write documentation for every class and method.
* **Keeps Documentation Up-to-Date:**  The documentation is automatically generated from your source code, so it's always in sync with the latest changes.
* **Consistent Format:**  The generated documentation has a consistent format and style, making it easier to read and navigate.
* **Detailed API Information:**  Doxygen can extract detailed information from your code, including class hierarchies, function parameters, and code examples.

**Other Documentation Generators**

Besides Doxygen, there are other documentation generators you might consider, such as:

* **Sphinx:**  A popular documentation generator often used for Python projects but can also be used for C++.
* **DocFX:**  A documentation generator from Microsoft that supports C# and other .NET languages, as well as C++.

**Recommendation**

I recommend using a documentation generator like Doxygen for your Versa Engine's API Reference. It will save you a significant amount of time and effort while ensuring your API documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.
