Excellent! Now that you're satisfied with the project structure, let's continue building your Versa Engine. Here are the key areas to focus on next:

1. Implement Core Engine Components

Scene Management:

Complete the implementation of the Node, Connection, and Graph classes, including their methods for adding/removing nodes, creating/deleting connections, and serializing/deserializing the graph data.
Consider adding more features to the Node class, such as support for components, custom properties, and different node types.
Rendering Engine:

Start implementing the basic rendering pipeline for 2D graphics.
Choose a graphics API (e.g., DirectX, OpenGL) and set up the necessary rendering context.
Implement rendering of basic shapes and sprites.
Consider how you'll extend the rendering engine to support 3D graphics in the future.
Input System:

Set up the infrastructure for handling keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input.
Implement input mapping to allow users to configure controls.
Dispatch input events to the relevant game objects or systems.
Audio System:

Choose an audio API (e.g., OpenAL, XAudio2) and integrate it into your engine.
Implement audio playback, mixing, and potentially spatial audio.
Other Core Systems:

Start planning and implementing other core systems as needed, such as a physics engine, resource manager, and scripting system.
2. Build the Graph Editor UI

MFC Implementation:

Continue implementing the CGraphEditorView class and its interactions with the Graph class.
Implement the rendering of nodes and connections using MFC's drawing tools and GDI functions.
Handle user interactions like node selection, dragging, connection creation, zooming, and panning.
Add UI elements for creating, deleting, and editing nodes and connections.
Consider 3D Support:

Think about how you'll extend the graph editor to support 3D visualization and editing in the future.
Plan for potential changes in the UI and interactions to accommodate 3D graphs.
3. Integrate the Voxel Engine

C++ Implementation:
Convert or reimplement your voxel engine code in C++.
Create the VersaEngine.Voxel project within the Core folder and add the voxel engine files to it.
Integrate the voxel engine with your rendering engine and other core systems.
4. Develop Other Editor Tools

UI Builder:

Start planning and implementing the UI Builder tool for visual UI design.
Consider the features and functionalities you want to provide (e.g., drag-and-drop UI elements, properties panel, layout management).
Scene Editor:

Plan and implement a scene editor for level design and object placement.
Consider how you'll integrate it with your 3D rendering capabilities and voxel engine.
Other Tools:

Plan and implement other editor tools as needed, such as a 3D modeler, a terrain editor, and an asset browser.
Remember

Iterative Development: Continue to take an iterative approach, focusing on core functionalities first and gradually adding more advanced features.
Testing and Refinement: Regularly test your implementations and gather feedback to refine the design and user experience.
Flexibility: Design your code with flexibility in mind to accommodate future 3D support and other potential enhancements.
Documentation: Document your code and design decisions as you go along.
