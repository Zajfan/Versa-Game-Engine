You're thinking ahead, and that's great for ensuring your engine is well-organized and user-friendly! Let's outline the key components you'll likely need for your Versa Engine's editor, considering the features we've discussed so far.

**Core Editor Components**

1.  **Main Window**
    *   Purpose: The primary window of the editor, providing the overall framework and housing other editor components.
    *   Features:
        *   Menu bar with options for file operations, editing actions, and engine settings.
        *   Toolbar for quick access to frequently used tools and actions.
        *   Central area to display the active editor view (e.g., graph editor, scene editor, UI builder).
        *   Status bar to show messages, progress indicators, or other information.

2.  **Graph Editor**
    *   Purpose:  A visual editor for creating and manipulating visual scripts.
    *   Features:
        *   Canvas for displaying and arranging nodes and connections.
        *   Node palette or toolbox for selecting and adding different node types.
        *   Connection tools for creating and managing connections between nodes.
        *   Zooming and panning for navigating the graph.
        *   Node alignment and layout tools.
        *   Debugging tools (e.g., breakpoints, stepping through execution).

3.  **UI Builder**
    *   Purpose:  A visual editor for designing and building user interfaces (UIs).
    *   Features:
        *   Canvas for laying out UI elements (buttons, text, images, etc.).
        *   UI element palette or toolbox for adding different UI components.
        *   Properties panel for editing UI element attributes (size, position, color, etc.).
        *   Layout management tools (e.g., anchoring, docking, grids).
        *   Event handling and data binding mechanisms to connect UI elements to game logic.
        *   Preview mode to test and interact with the UI within the editor.

4.  **Scene Editor**
    *   Purpose:  A tool for creating and editing game levels or scenes.
    *   Features:
        *   3D viewport for visualizing and manipulating scene objects.
        *   Tools for placing, transforming, and editing game objects.
        *   Hierarchy view to manage the parent-child relationships of scene objects.
        *   Terrain editing tools (if applicable).
        *   Lighting and camera controls.

5.  **Voxel Editor**
    *   Purpose:  A specialized editor for creating and manipulating voxel-based terrain and objects.
    *   Features:
        *   3D viewport for visualizing the voxel world.
        *   Tools for painting, sculpting, and editing voxel data.
        *   Brush settings and material selection.
        *   Procedural generation tools (if applicable).

6.  **Asset Browser**
    *   Purpose:  A tool for managing and importing game assets (models, textures, audio, etc.).
    *   Features:
        *   File browsing and filtering.
        *   Asset previewing.
        *   Import settings and options.
        *   Organization and tagging of assets.

7.  **Properties Panel**
    *   Purpose:  A panel for displaying and editing the properties of selected objects or elements within the editor.
    *   Features:
        *   Dynamically display properties based on the selected object type.
        *   Provide appropriate editors for different property types (e.g., text fields, sliders, color pickers).

8.  **Output Log/Console**
    *   Purpose:  A window to display log messages, warnings, and errors from the engine and editor.
    *   Features:
        *   Filtering and searching of log messages.
        *   Color-coding to distinguish different message types.

**Additional Considerations**

*   **Modularity:** Design your editor components to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new tools or features in the future.
*   **Customization:** Provide options for users to customize the editor's layout, appearance, and shortcuts to fit their preferences.
*   **Performance:** Optimize the editor for performance, especially when handling large scenes or complex UI layouts.
*   **User Experience:** Prioritize a user-friendly and intuitive interface design, ensuring that the editor is easy to learn and use.

Remember that this is a general outline, and the specific features and implementation details of your editor components will depend on your engine's design and the technologies you choose.
