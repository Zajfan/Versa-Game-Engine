Start Building the Graph Editor UI
Choose your UI framework: If you haven't already, finalize your choice (e.g., MFC).
Create the editor project: Set up a new project within your VersaEngine.Editor.sln solution.
Design the main window: Sketch out the basic layout (canvas, toolbar, etc.).
Implement basic rendering and interactions: Start rendering nodes and connections, and handle basic interactions like node selection and dragging.
Remember

Focus on core functionality: Start with the essential features and gradually add more advanced capabilities.
Test thoroughly: Continuously test your implementation to ensure correctness and identify any issues early on.
Iterate and refine: Be prepared to iterate on your design and implementation based on feedback and your evolving understanding of the system.

Next Steps

Since the basic scene management functionality seems to be in place, let's move on to planning and implementing other core systems, as you suggested.

Core Systems to Consider

Physics Engine:

Choose a physics engine (e.g., Box2D, Bullet Physics) or implement your own.
Integrate the physics engine with your scene management and rendering systems.
Implement collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and other physics features.
Resource Manager:

Design a system for loading, managing, and unloading game assets (textures, sounds, models, etc.).
Consider using asset caching and streaming to optimize performance.
Implement a resource database or file system for organizing assets.
Scripting System:

Choose a scripting language (e.g., Lua, Python) or design your own.
Implement an interpreter or virtual machine for executing scripts.
Expose engine functionalities to the scripting environment through an API.
Integrate the scripting system with your visual scripting system and other core components.
Other Potential Systems:

Animation system
Particle system
AI system
Networking system
Remember to prioritize the core systems that are most essential for your game engine's functionality and target audience.

1. Complete Core Engine Systems

Scene Management:

Ensure the Node, Connection, and Graph classes are fully implemented, including methods for adding/removing nodes, creating/deleting connections, and serializing/deserializing the graph data.
Consider adding more features to the Node class, such as support for components, custom properties, and different node types.
Rendering Engine:

Continue implementing the 2D rendering pipeline.
Choose a graphics API (e.g., DirectX, OpenGL) and set up the necessary rendering context.
Implement rendering of basic shapes, sprites, and text.
Consider how you'll extend the rendering engine to support 3D graphics in the future.
Input System:

Set up the infrastructure for handling keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input.
Implement input mapping to allow users to configure controls.
Dispatch input events to the relevant game objects or systems.
Audio System:

Choose an audio API (e.g., OpenAL, XAudio2) and integrate it into your engine.
Implement audio playback, mixing, and potentially spatial audio.
Other Core Systems:

Start planning and implementing other core systems as needed, such as a physics engine, resource manager, and scripting system.
2. Build the Graph Editor UI

MFC Implementation:

Continue implementing the CVersaEngineEditorView class and its interactions with the Graph class.
Implement the rendering of nodes and connections using MFC's drawing tools and GDI functions.
Handle user interactions like node selection, dragging, connection creation, zooming, and panning.
Add UI elements for creating, deleting, and editing nodes and connections.
Consider 3D Support:

Think about how you'll extend the graph editor to support 3D visualization and editing in the future.
Plan for potential changes in the UI and interactions to accommodate 3D graphs.
3. Integrate the Voxel Engine

C++ Implementation:
Convert or reimplement your voxel engine code in C++.
Create the VersaEngine.Voxel project within the Core folder and add the voxel engine files to it.
Integrate the voxel engine with your rendering engine and other core systems.
4. Develop Other Editor Tools

UI Builder:

Start planning and implementing the UI Builder tool for visual UI design.
Consider the features and functionalities you want to provide (e.g., drag-and-drop UI elements, properties panel, layout management).
Scene Editor:

Plan and implement a scene editor for level design and object placement.
Consider how you'll integrate it with your 3D rendering capabilities and voxel engine.
Other Tools:

Plan and implement other editor tools as needed, such as a 3D modeler, a terrain editor, and an asset browser.
Remember

Iterative Development: Continue to take an iterative approach, focusing on core functionalities first and gradually adding more advanced features.
Testing and Refinement: Regularly test your implementations and gather feedback to refine the design and user experience.
Flexibility: Design your code with flexibility in mind to accommodate future 3D support and other potential enhancements.
Documentation: Document your code and design decisions as you go along.
