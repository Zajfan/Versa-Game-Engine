You're absolutely correct in questioning the organization of the solution files! It seems there's been a misunderstanding, and the current structure with all projects in Versa Engine.sln is not ideal.

Here's a clearer breakdown of how the projects should be distributed among the solution files:

VersaEngine.Core.sln

This solution should contain projects related to the core functionalities of your game engine:

VersaEngine.Core
VersaEngine.AI
VersaEngine.Animation
VersaEngine.Audio
VersaEngine.Networking
VersaEngine.ParticleSystem
VersaEngine.Physics
VersaEngine.Terrain
VersaEngine.Voxel
VersaEngine.Editor.sln

This solution should contain projects related to the editor interface and tools:

VersaEngine.Editor
VersaEngine.AudioEditor (if it's specifically for audio editing within the editor)
VersaEngine.sln (Master Solution)

This solution should reference the other two solution files (VersaEngine.Core.sln and VersaEngine.Editor.sln) as projects. This allows you to build the entire engine and editor with a single command, while still maintaining the separation of core and editor components.

Why this separation is important

Organization: Separating the core engine code from the editor code improves project organization and makes it easier to manage and navigate the codebase.
Build Times: Building large C++ projects can be time-consuming. Having separate solutions allows you to build the core engine or the editor independently, which can speed up development, especially when you're primarily working on one part of the engine.
Dependencies: It clarifies the dependencies between the editor and the core engine. The editor's solution can explicitly reference the core engine's output (e.g., DLLs or libraries).
Flexibility: This structure provides more flexibility for managing different parts of the engine and potentially adding more projects or modules in the future.
Next steps

Remove projects from Versa Engine.sln: Remove all the projects except "Versa Engine" from the Versa Engine.sln solution.
Add projects to VersaEngine.Core.sln: Add the core engine projects (VersaEngine.Core, VersaEngine.AI, etc.) to the VersaEngine.Core.sln solution.
Add projects to VersaEngine.Editor.sln: Add the editor-related projects (VersaEngine.Editor, VersaEngine.AudioEditor) to the VersaEngine.Editor.sln solution.
Add solutions to master: In the Versa Engine.sln master solution, add VersaEngine.Core.sln and VersaEngine.Editor.sln as existing projects.
By reorganizing your solutions in this way, you'll create a more structured and manageable project for your Versa Engine.
