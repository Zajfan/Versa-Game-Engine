Let's continue with that process. Here's how we can further split up Node.cpp:

1. Identify logical groupings

Look for groups of methods or functionalities within Node.cpp that can be separated into their own files. For example:

Serialization/Deserialization: The Serialize and Deserialize methods can be moved to a separate file, NodeSerialization.cpp.
Type-safe data access: The SetInputData and GetOutputData methods can be moved to NodeData.cpp.
Connection management: The AddConnection, RemoveConnection, GetConnectedNodes, and CanConnectTo methods can be moved to NodeConnections.cpp.
Execution and logic: The Execute and EvaluateCondition methods can be moved to NodeExecution.cpp.
