Advanced Data and Execution Features

Input/Output Data Handling:

Data Validation: Add validation checks to SetInputData to ensure the data being passed to the node is within acceptable bounds or meets certain criteria. This can prevent errors and improve the robustness of your graphs.
Data Conversion: Provide mechanisms for automatic data conversion between compatible types (e.g., int to float) if necessary. This can make it more convenient for users to connect nodes with slightly different data types.
Multiple Outputs: Allow nodes to have multiple output pins, enabling them to produce different types of data or trigger multiple actions.
Execution Control:

Execution Triggers: Explore adding mechanisms to trigger the execution of a node based on events or conditions other than just the default data flow. This could involve:
Event listeners: Allow nodes to register as listeners for specific events and execute when those events occur.
Custom triggers: Allow users to define custom trigger conditions for nodes.
Asynchronous Operations: For nodes that perform time-consuming operations (e.g., loading assets, network requests), consider adding support for asynchronous execution to avoid blocking the main thread.
