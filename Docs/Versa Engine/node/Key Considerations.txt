Key considerations

Validation Rules: Carefully define the validation rules for each pin based on its purpose and expected input values.
Error Handling: Choose an error handling strategy that aligns with your engine's design. You might want to provide informative error messages to the user or log errors for debugging purposes.
Performance: If the validation logic is complex, consider its potential impact on performance and optimize it if necessary.
