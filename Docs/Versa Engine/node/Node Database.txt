also why i initially mentioned a node database is simply because that's how i assume that with maybe 100 000 different nodes for the visual scripting language for versa engine 

It's understandable that you're thinking about how to manage a vast number of nodes for your visual scripting system! A node database could indeed be a suitable approach for organizing and accessing such a large collection of nodes.

Here's how a node database could be beneficial for your Versa Engine:

Efficient Storage and Retrieval: 
A database can efficiently store and retrieve information about a large number of nodes, including their properties, functionalities, and connections.

Organization and Categorization: 
A database allows you to organize nodes into categories, hierarchies, or tags, making it easier for users to find and select the nodes they need.

Search and Filtering: 
You can implement search and filtering mechanisms to help users quickly locate nodes based on keywords, categories, or other criteria.
Metadata and Documentation: You can store additional metadata about each node, such as descriptions, examples, or links to documentation, making it easier for users to understand and use the nodes.

Versioning and Updates: A database can help you manage different versions of nodes or handle updates to node functionalities more effectively.

Custom Nodes: You can allow users to create and store their own custom nodes in the database, extending the engine's capabilities.


Implementing a Node Database

Choose a Database System: 
Select a database system that suits your needs. Some options include:
SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database that's easy to integrate.

MySQL or PostgreSQL: 
More robust, server-based databases that can handle larger amounts of data and concurrent access.

Design the Database Schema: Define the tables and fields you'll need to store node information (e.g., name, type, category, description, input/output pins, etc.).

Populate the Database: Populate the database with your initial set of nodes. You can potentially automate this process by parsing node definitions from files or using scripting.

Integrate with the Editor: Integrate the node database with your graph editor UI, allowing users to browse, search, and select nodes from the database.

Provide API Access: Expose an API for accessing and manipulating the node database from within the engine or from scripts.

Performance: Optimize database queries and access patterns to ensure efficient performance, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes.

Scalability: Choose a database system that can scale to accommodate the growing number of nodes and potential user contributions.

User Experience: Design the UI for interacting with the node database to be user-friendly and intuitive.


By implementing a node database, you can effectively manage and organize a vast collection of nodes for your visual scripting system, making it easier for users to find, understand, and utilize the nodes to create complex game logic.
