4. Performance and Optimization

Lazy Evaluation: For nodes that perform expensive calculations, consider using lazy evaluation techniques to only compute their outputs when they are actually needed.
Memoization: For nodes with pure functions (i.e., functions that always produce the same output for the same input), consider using memoization to cache results and avoid redundant computations.

Remember

Prioritize features that align with your engine's goals and target audience.
Strive for a balance between flexibility and complexity.
Gather feedback from users to ensure the added features are useful and intuitive.
